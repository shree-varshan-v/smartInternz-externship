# SmartInternz Robotics Externship Repository

Welcome! This repository contains all the assignments given during the first month of the program and the project completed during the second month, which involves building an object detection robot simulation in ROS using Gazebo and RViz.

## Externship Details
- **Externship Period:** July 2021 - August 2021

## Project Overview
In this externship, we worked on building a robot simulation with object detection capabilities using ROS, Gazebo, and RViz. The assignments provided in the first month were foundational to understanding the concepts applied in the project. This repository includes all the code, documentation, and resources related to the project.

## Prerequisites
To run the code in this repository, you'll need:
- **Ubuntu OS** with **ROS** installed.

## Repository Contents
- **Assignments:** The assignments folder contains all the tasks completed during the first month of the externship program.
- **Project:** The project folder includes the code and documentation for the object detection robot simulation in ROS using Gazebo and RViz.
