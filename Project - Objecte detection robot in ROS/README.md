# Externship Project: Object Detection Robot Simulation

This project was developed by Shree Varshan V and team as part of the SmartInternz Robotics Externship program.

## Project Description
The objective of this project was to create a robot simulation with object detection capabilities using the YOLOv3 model. The project demonstrates the integration of YOLOv3 object detection into a ROS environment, allowing the robot to identify and interact with objects in its surroundings.

## Prerequisites
